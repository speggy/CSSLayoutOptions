		<h2>Text Columns</h2>
			<p>Text columns arrange the specified elements vertically. Columns can be added to a single element and can also span multiple elements by targeting the parent element. They can be coded to have a specified width as well as a column count. Columns also allow a rule between them that has a specified width, color, and style. Gaps between the columns can also be increased or decreased. </p>
			<p>See an exmaple of Text Columns <a href="columns.html">here</a>.</p>
		<h2>FlexBox</h2>
			<p>Flexbox is a layout option that organizes the page in a container/item relationship. An element can act as a container that holds children elements as its items. Flexbox allows ordering of the items which makes it easy to reorganize the page without changing the HTML code. Some of the functionality of Flexboxes includes: positioning the items within the container, modifying the size of the item, wrapping the content, alignment of the items, etc. </p>
